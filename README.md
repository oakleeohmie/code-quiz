# code-quiz
This is a quiz on basic JS.
When you open the quiz up, there's a start quiz button and a timer set to zero. After you click the start quiz button,
the timer starts. The first question pops up. After you read the question, you click on an answer. Based on your choice, if it
is wrong, the timer will have 15 seconds deducted from it. If it's right, the timer will be left alone. The next question will
automatically pop up after the previous one is answered. After all questions have been answered, the quiz will show you your
score and the timer will end.
